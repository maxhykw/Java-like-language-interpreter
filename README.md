# Kawa Interpreter

This project implements an interpreter named Kawa for a custom OOP language inspired by Java. The interpreter includes a lexer (created with ocamllex) for tokenizing the source code, a parser (generated by Menhir) for constructing an abstract syntax tree, a type checker to ensure type correctness, and an interpreter that directly executes the code.
It covers core Java-like OOP features, such as:

- Arithmetic operations: Basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and boolean calculations.
- Variables: Supports variable declarations (with or without initial values), and manipulation of global, local, and class attribute variables.
- Control structures: Implements control flow with if-else and while loops.
- Classes and attributes: Defines classes with mutable or final attributes and manages them in objects.
- Methods: Supports method calls, including nested calls, with proper handling of parameters, local variables, and this pointers.
- Inheritance: Implements parent-child class relationships, access to inherited attributes and methods, and type checking for subtypes.

Additionally, several advanced features and extensions have been implemented:

- Immutable fields (final attributes).
- Array support (including multidimensional arrays).
- Equality checks and type tests (e.g., instanceof).
- Series declarations for multiple variables and initialization with values.

The interpreter allows the execution of custom Java-like code while ensuring proper type checking and semantic correctness.
